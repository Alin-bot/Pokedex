# Pokedex

A React project which uses JS, html and css, that simulates a Pokedex like app.

This is my first React project, which sowed me the beauty of this framework.

The app was made during Fii Practic courses, more exactly as weekly homeworks, each weak having more features to be added.

The app is making Api calls to pokeapi, taking the data of pokemons and processing the json files that we get. Some datas that we are working with are the name of the pokemon, the unique id, the type of that pokemon etc., and then we are displaying them, using various components in form of a card.

The app features a search bar which is providing a filter option for names, ids and the props of each pokemon card.

Clicking on a pokemon card, you will be redirected to the details of that pokemon. Many informations can be viewed from there, like stats, evolutions, description, sprites etc. via informations got from more Api calls.

An error page can be accesed too by giving a bad url or by accesing a pokemon id that is not between 0 and 999.
