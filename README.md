# Pokedex

Site url: https://pink-pika-36bbe0.netlify.app/

A React project which uses JS, HTML and SCSS, that simulates a Pokedex like app.

This is my first React project, which sowed me the beauty of this framework.

The app was made during Fii Practic courses, more exactly as weekly homeworks, each week having more features to be added. In the end, this was the final project of the course.

The app is making API calls to pokeapi, processing the json files and taking the data of pokemons. Some datas that we are working with are the name of the pokemon, the unique id, the type of that pokemon etc., and then we are displaying them, using various components in form of a card.

The app features a search bar which is providing a filter option for names, ids and the props of each pokemon card.

Clicking on a pokemon card, you will be redirected to the details of that pokemon. Many informations can be viewed from there, like stats, evolutions, description, sprites etc. via informations got from more API calls.

The app is responsive too, working on both smartphone's and PC's browsers.

An error page can be accesed too by giving a bad url or by accesing a pokemon id that is not between 0 and 999.
