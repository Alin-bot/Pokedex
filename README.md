# Pokedex

A React project which uses JS, html and css, that simulates a Pokedex like app.

This is my first React project, which sowed me the beauty of this framework.

The app is processing a json file, which has the data of some pokemons, like the name of it, an unique id, the type of that pokemon etc., and displays them, using various components in form of a card.

The app features a search bar which is providing a filter option for names, ids and the props of each pokemon card.

Clicking on a pokemon card, you will be redirected to the details of that pokemon. Many informations can be viewed from there, like stats, evolutions, description, sprites etc.

An error page can be accesed too by giving a bad url or by accesing a pokemon id that is not between 0 and 999.
